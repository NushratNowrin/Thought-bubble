			"Problems within a couple relationship can cause deep and profound damage to both parties, to children and to the wider family and social network. Relationship coaching works best when both people can attend sessions together. At Thought-Bubble, whatever the problem might be, we will work with you in a non-judgemental way. We focus on trying to help couples develop a constructive dialogue with each other, to gain an understanding of themselves and each other both as individuals and as part of a couple. And we make no presumptions about couples staying together or separating, so whatever the future holds for the relationship, helping both parties to work through difficulties constructively is our goal.",
